Chapter 1 – Justice

Enoch is a professional burglar who works for a drug lord called Blizzard. On a mission to steal a tissue generator once, Enoch was surrounded by Interpol agents, but he managed to escape after severely injuring one of them called Wanda. Sharon was tasked to capture Enoch along with Anya, a rookie who just joined Interpol. Together, they tracked down Enoch who broke into a lab to steal some raw materials to power up the tissue generator. Enoch escaped again with his partner-in-crime, Yumi, after they ignited the bomb armed on the pillars. After they fled, Yumi judged if Enoch was betraying her as she found a photo of Enoch with another Interpol agent. Before Enoch had time to explain, the agents had surrounded them and Yumi fled from the scene. Enoch was apprehended and found guilty of killing Wanda. However, Sharon broke him out of prison soon after and requested him to help her capture Blizzard. Enoch agreed if he would be allowed to use the tissue generator to help save his brother once Blizzard was arrested. The two headed to Blizzard’s base, but Sharon quickly realized Blizzard was only a puppet, but Yumi was the real mastermind instead. Enoch fought against Yumi, whilst Sharon fought against Yumi’s secretary, Aeren. Yumi suddenly revealed to Enoch that Sharon was the one who killed Wanda and framed Enoch, just for him to make a deal with Sharon to catch herself. Enoch didn’t believe her, but when he was distracted, he was quickly overpowered by Yumi and was held hostage. Meanwhile, Sharon showed up and ordered Yumi to surrender. Aeren then suddenly appeared behind Yumi and with the three combined, Yumi was defeated and put under handcuffs. It turned out that Sharon asked Aeren to help them and promised to let her take over Yumi’s empire after she is sent behind bars. Enoch said he disagreed with how Sharon performs justice, but Sharon simply said they both gain some advantages out of this madness. Soon after, Sharon received a call from Interpol saying an anonymous source gave them footage of Sharon framing Enoch. Enoch and Sharon were sent on trial along with Yumi, and the three of them all ended up in jail. Enoch asked why Sharon let Aeren continue running Yumi’s drug empire, but Sharon defended that Aeren will be defeated within days without Yumi’s assistance. As the two were speaking, they were called to the Warden’s office and Aeren was already waiting for them there. She thanked the two for letting her take Yumi’s place and told them not to make a scene in prison as she would always have an eye on them. Despite being sentenced, Enoch was still allowed to use the tissue generator before going into prison. Using his DNA, it created an artificial skin for his brother, Eamon, whose face was half-burnt. It turned out that Eamon and Yumi used to be partners in the Interpol, and on a mission once, they were tasked to take down the drug lord Blizzard. The two secretly kidnapped Blizzard’s daughter but accidentally killed Blizzard’s wife. Yumi knew Blizzard would take revenge, so she approached Blizzard herself, telling him it was Eamon who killed his wife. Yumi then turned to working for Blizzard whilst Blizzard’s men ambushed Eamon, causing half of his face to be burned. After some years, Blizzard was killed by one of his foes and he left his whole drug empire to Yumi, who now became his partner-in-crime.

He then headed to Ryan’s mansion, where Ryan held a party at, and kidnapped Sherman. Curtis forced Ryan to pay him 500000 USD, or else he would announce to the world how Sherman killed her daughter. Ryan did so, but Curtis then required Ryan to give him Carter’s Enterprises, Ryan’s company. Ryan seemingly gave in, but he prepared to defeat Curtis when he met him in-person. However, Ryan was no match to Curtis and was quickly overpowered. Curtis then forced Ryan to sexually assault Sherman as payback to how Curtis lost his daughter.
