### Chapter I

## Ryan

_“Love is not manipulation. The moment you try to control love is the moment you lose it.”_

“My invention will help millions,” I was invited to Harvard to give a speech about my latest invention, “no, billions in fact, but I truly think that you guys can do the same in the near future. Some might say I am born with great talents, but I’m just the same as you guys. I’m also a boy whose heart was filled with curiosity.” 

I slowly walked down the stage and continued, “I remember when I was 8 years old, I created my first fully-automatic robot. Then one grew into ten, and ten grew into a hundred. Then I earned myself a company. And now when I look at you guys, I see dozens of faces resembling my own. I couldn’t live with the fact that a breakthrough cannot be reached simply due to a lack of some kick-off funding. So, here I am, not as some professionals but as a friend. All of your projects are now being sponsored by me. Now get up everyone! Carve out a niche of your own!”

They clapped, just like the students from Oxford and and MIT. “Now, back onto my invention. This is Matthew, a fully automatic artificial intelligence. Our company has been developing it for more than half a decade, and I’m now honoured to announce its global release here in Harvard. Harvard had the pleasure to witness how my passion towards computer science develops, and I believe it is only right for my alma mater to see my greatest accomplishment yet as well.” The students applauded again.

“You might ask, how can Matthew help us? We already have robots working in different positions in our society nowadays, what’s the purpose for introducing an artificial intelligence?” I gradually rambled towards Matthew, “well he could think, he could learn, he has emotions. In fact, he’s not that different from us human beings. After the global launch, Matthew is only sold at $3600 USD. Every single one of you can have a robot servant in the distant future. He could help you with cooking, with your homework, or even act as your loved ones.” 

I saw a group of students sitting in the front row forcing a girl to ask me a question. “Sir?” The girl raised her hand and asked, “what inspired you into creating artificial intelligence?”

That was none other than my daughter Aeren. Her classmates probably didn’t want to ask themselves, so they requested her to raise the question. 

“That’s kinda personal. I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you that. Perhaps at home, but definitely not here.” I laughed. Aeren’s classmates didn’t seem satisfied, but they didn’t get another chance to ask. I headed to the backstage where my secretary, Jeanie, has been waiting for me.

“Mr Carter,” the headmaster was standing to Jeanie the whole time, “it’s our honour for you to give a speech at our school.”

“No, the honour’s mine.” I answered and shook his hand. Jeanie and I then left the theatre, but before we could head to the parking lot, a group of paparazzis were waiting for us. They surrounded me and asked for details about my new invention. Jeanie simply told them there wouldn’t be any questions today and escorted me to the car park. There, my daughter was already waiting for me.

“You embarrassed me in front of my classmates.” Aeren said as Jeanie and I got onto her car. As Aeren also studied in Harvard, Jeanie and I came here on her ride.

She sounded a little pissed, but so was I. “You shouldn’t have embarrassed yourself. You know I wouldn’t have answered that question.”

Silence. Aeren didn’t know to what to respond, so she simply started the engine and started driving. Aeren just got her driving licence, so she doesn’t really drive that well. If she hadn’t insist, I wouldn’t have boarded her BMW when we came to her school. 

“My classmates forced me to.” She suddenly broke the awkward silence. “I didn’t want to let them down.”

“There’s a line to everything. You know I don’t want to share that, that’s still haunting me.” I looked at her and said, “I’ve made the line pretty clear. You’re the one who stepped over it.”

“Did that give you a reason for roasting me? In front of my classmates? Dad, all my reputation at school is gone.”

“You chose to ask, not me. What do you think would happen to me if I answered? Huh? Is your reputation more important than mine?” I asked. 

It was dead silent again. Jeanie was sitting at the back of the car, too afraid to slip into our argument. Aeren didn’t answer but simply accelerated.

“Don’t drive that fast. You can make a scene and get a speeding ticket.” I warned her gently.

“Relax, everything will be fine. There isn’t any cameras stationed on campus that will record my speed.” Despite having already boarded the car for 3 minutes, we were still driving in the school, as it takes quite a number of turns to reach the main entrance.

But it went sideways as expected. When Aeren was arguing with me, the car bumped into someone.

“What have you done?” It was a large shock when the car hit. I checked on Aeren and Jeanie; they were both fine. I then opened the door and hopped off the car. Red was everywhere.

Blood splattered all over the place. Some got onto my car, some spilled on a neighbouring lamppost, but the majority of it was on the road, where the girl we bumped into was lying on.

Aeren was still conscious, but she didn’t know what to do. “She’s Venus. I… I just…” She mumbled in the car.

“Stay calm.” Apart from the girl we hit, a man was also lying on the ground unconscious. I quickly rushed towards the girl and felt for her heart beat. It was dead silence. I could hear the birds squeaking on the tree, I could hear the breeze blowing all over my face, but I simply couldn’t hear the sound I was expecting.

“We need to call the ambulance!” Aeren used all her strength and screamed at me, but I was too afraid to do so. My daughter’s career will be all gone if I hand her over to the police.

“Stay calm!” I dashed back to the car, but I was the one who was panicking instead. I opened the door, instructing Aeren to come out. I then
