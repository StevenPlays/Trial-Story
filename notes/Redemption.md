**Redemption**
#Ryan is a famous scientist in 2022. Despite his success in his career, he realized his wife, #Wanda, another brilliant scientist, has been cheating on him with her secretary, #Curtis. The two had an argument, and #Ryan accidentally killed Wanda after he prevented her from leaving. In order to not be caught, #Ryan took it upon himself and used the time-travelling technology his company has been secretly inventing to go back in time. #Ryan prohibited himself from killing #Wanda and he used the time machine to fix things when the two had an argument. Not long after, #Wanda realized how #Ryan was controlling their lives. She told #Ryan love is not owning the person but a mutual sharing and understanding. #Wanda then left #Ryan for good and this time, #Ryan didn't go back in time. Instead, after thinking a whole night through, #Ryan prepared to announce his time-travelling technology to the world, but before he could do so, his tech was stolen by his ex-secretary, #Curtis, and reality was altered completely, with #Curtis now being #Ryan's boss.
