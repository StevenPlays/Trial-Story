# Description
      

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Predestined is a story exploring different themes related to death and the purpose of life. In a world where time-travelling exists, is there actually free will left for the rest of the people? Who owns the rights to facilitate others’ life when all of us are equal? If one don’t want to live, is he worth saving? All of these are addressed in different chapters of the novel. 

  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different from other conventional storybooks, each chapter of Predestined focuses on different characters, written in the first person narrative. Some chapters may not seem to be interconnected, but they all build up to the final climax. Each story has its own dynamic and unique structure, and hence is worth every bit of reading.
