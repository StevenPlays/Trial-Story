Curtis loses wife and daughter Venus (killed by Aeren)
Curtis takes revenge, traumatizing Aeren as she was sexually assulted by her father, Ryan
Curtis was recruited to form the Time Bureau, while Moon and Aeren left Ryan
Ryan and Moon had an argument and Ryan accidentally killed Moon
Ryan started looking into time-travelling in an attempt to revert reality
He returned to the moment Curtis forced him to fuxk Aeren. He shot Curtis in advance saving Aeren.
In this new reality, Moon didn't leave Ryan, but Ryan realized Moon had been acting weird
She found this new reality a little weird as she has memories of the past reality when she visited several places, but Ryan simply used time travelling to fix things
One time Moon finds it weird again and Ryan lost control, revealing he did a lot of things so that their relationship won't come to an end. Ryan told everything to Moon that he sexually assaulted Aeren before, but this time Moon didn't leave him, but instead she stayed beside him and offer him support
Moon suggested Ryan to announce the time-travelling technology to the world, but before he could do so, Jeanie (Ryan's secretary) stole it
In this new world, 



Jeanie becomes rich and she tracks down Ryan, because she wants his help to save her childhood friend, Mattew
Jeanie promises to restore everything back to normal just under one condition - Matthew is brought back to life
Jeanie saves her childhoold friend, Matthew, using the device
Despite having Jeanie as his girlfriend, Matthew still cheats on Jeanie
Jeanie still tolerates Matthew because she felt like she caused him to die in original reality, so everytime Mattew cheats Jeanie will go back in time and revert things
Jeanie approaches Ryan again hoping he would have a solution so that Matthew will be her true soulmate and not cheating
Ryan said true love is built on free-will, he doesn't love u at first place, then why still forcing him to be in love with u?
Hence, Jeanie finally let go. In order to restore reality, Jeanie and Ryan went back to the night when Jeanie announces the time-travelling invention. The two aimed to pass the device to young Ryan so that he can use it to restore reality, but they were held captive by past Jeanie who is still obsessed with money
Without any choices left, Jeanie stepped up and revealed to the public that she stole Ryan's idea, and the invention is all Ryan's idea. However, this causes a serious timequake. Before Ryan and Jeanie die, a portal opened, and it was Curtis.



Trade-Off story
Enoch keeps (Chapter IV) (Trade-Off ends)
Sharon keeps (Chapter V) (Prison Break)
- Jeanie was informed by Ryan's new secretary that her mother needs liver transplant, but was told she couldn't leave jail and Ryan's hands were tied
- Jeanie asked Enoch for help to break out, Enoch rejected
- Curtis broke into the prison, looking for Jeanie
- Jeanie told Curtis that she wasn't the one who killed Venus
- Yumi asked Enoch and Sharon to help Jeanie break out, in return Yumi will tell them Aeren's wherabouts 
- The 4 broke out of prison, but when Jeanie arrived at the hospital, her mom just passed away
- Jeanie hence went to Carter's Industries to plot revenge against Ryan, but he miracally got her hands on Ryan's time machine. She used it to revert time to moments before her mom died. But no matter how hard she tried, her mom still died. She hence travelled way back in time and took Ryan's place. She became Ryan's boss. (pick up from above)
- In this new reality, Enoch decided to join Yumi's side. Sharon refused, and Enoch hence shot her. Yumi, Aeren and Enoch soon rose to power with their human tissue regenerator technology.
- (Yumi storyline ends)

- Curtis recruits RJ and teaches them how to fix branch timelines, tell them doomsday is 3 timelines away
- Trio travels to 2022 to stop an anachronism as a teenage girl named Hailee wanted to stop the atomic bombing. Trio tells her she's creating branch timelines that will lead to doomsday (but in fact they are unrelated, the Fates just want to train the Time Agents)
- Hailee originally lived in 2344 but her parents were killed in a bombing in Korea
- 

- Katherine uses time-travelling technology to stop anachronism in 1945, causing a huge branch where Japanese population quadripled. (Earth was seriously polluted by radiation so Katherine wanted to prevent the first atomic bomb from being invented)
- Trio meets Katherine for the first time in 1945 and Katherine realized their existence. Her second stop was 2023 when WWIII broke out. Katherine easily overpowered them and broke into the Zero Point. Katherine killed the three fates easily and destroyed the loom of fate before leaving. Jeanie asked what they could do and Curtis said they have to talk to the Fates. Curtis sensed that the loom of fate has been destroyed, meaning there aren't restrains anymore. Jeanie thought they could find Yumi to assist them as she got resources in the underground market, but she disappeared in 2020. Ryan built a time machine, and using Yumi's connection with the two other Fates, they traced them down and travelled to the Zero Point. (Curtis, Ryan, Jeanie, Yumi, Aeren, Enoch, Chantel, Windy)

- Katherine travelled back to Mars but everything was gone. In the distant future, without the loom of fate, the Lee's Industries was not created and humans didn't migrate to Mars. Mankind ended as the radiation polluted Earth entirely. Katherine began to travel to different points in time instructing people to build an ark to save human kind, but it also caused multiple branch timelines to be created.
