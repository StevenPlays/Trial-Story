He returned to the moment Curtis forced him to fuxk Aeren. He shot Curtis in advance saving Aeren.
In this new reality, Moon didn't leave Ryan, but Ryan realized Moon had been acting weird
She found this new reality a little weird as she has memories of the past reality when she visited several places, but Ryan simply used time travelling to fix things
One time Moon finds it weird again and Ryan lost control, revealing he did a lot of things so that their relationship won't come to an end. Ryan told everything to Moon that he sexually assaulted Aeren before, but this time Moon didn't leave him, but instead she stayed beside him and offer him support
Moon suggested Ryan to announce the time-travelling technology to the world, but before he could do so, Jeanie (Ryan's secretary) stole it
In this new world, 



Jeanie becomes rich and she tracks down Ryan, because she wants his help to save her childhood friend, Mattew
Jeanie promises to restore everything back to normal just under one condition - Matthew is brought back to life
Jeanie saves her childhoold friend, Matthew, using the device
Despite having Jeanie as his girlfriend, Matthew still cheats on Jeanie
Jeanie still tolerates Matthew because she felt like she caused him to die in original reality, so everytime Mattew cheats Jeanie will go back in time and revert things
Jeanie approaches Ryan again hoping he would have a solution so that Matthew will be her true soulmate and not cheating
Ryan said true love is built on free-will, he doesn't love u at first place, then why still forcing him to be in love with u?
Hence, Jeanie finally let go. In order to restore reality, Jeanie and Ryan went back to the night when Jeanie announces the time-travelling invention. The two aimed to pass the device to young Ryan so that he can use it to restore reality, but they were held captive by past Jeanie who is still obsessed with money
Without any choices left, Jeanie stepped up and revealed to the public that she stole Ryan's idea, and the invention is all Ryan's idea. However, this causes a serious timequake. Before Ryan and Jeanie die, a portal opened, and it was Curtis.
